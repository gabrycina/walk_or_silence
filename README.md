# Walk Or Silence

I believe music brings motivation, so walk and music will be played.

## Concept

You want to lose weight -> 
you run -> 
and **if you stop, the music stops**..so KEEP RUNNING <3

## Main challenge

The main challenge was to find a way to stop the music **INSTANTANEOUSLY** when the user stops.

Phones are very bad at understanding precisely when you are walking, so I had to come up with my own algorith that uses **Fourier Transformations and some other cool math**.

Really beautiful, **works WAY better**, but not perfect yet.

## Warning about this code

No fancy user interface is implemented in this project and some debug logs are continuously printed while using it. 
Hence the algorithm is what matters for this project.
When I'll complete the app, I'll use a different name and repository for it.

Much love <3
