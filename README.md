# Walk Or Silence

I believe music brings motivation, but it's also really good to listen to what we like.

## Concept

You want to lose weight -> 
so you run -> 
and **If you stop, the music stops**..so KEEP RUNNING <3

## Main challenge of this proj

The main challenge was to find a way to stop the music **INSTANTANEOUSLY** when the user stops.

But phones are very bad at understand precisely when you are walking, so I had to come up with my own algorith that uses **Fourier Transformations and some other cool math**.

Really beautiful, **works WAY better**, but not perfect yet.

## Warning about this code

No fancy user interface is implemented in this project and some debug logs are continuously printed while using it. 
Hence the algorithm is what matters for this project.
If I will complete the app, I will use a different name and repository for it.

Much love <3
